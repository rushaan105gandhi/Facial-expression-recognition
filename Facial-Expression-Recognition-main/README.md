# Facial-Expression-Recognition

We have trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Facial Expressions. 

Model Design:

**Total params:** 1,467,494

**Trainable params:** 1,467,494

**Non-trainable params:** 0

The types of expressions are:

1. 'sad'
2. 'happy' 
3. 'angry'
4. 'surprised'
5. 'fearful'
6. 'neutral'

We have used the Facial-Expression-Recognition 2013 Dataset to train our model.

We have achieved an accuracy of **81.44%**, **64.77%** and **63.75%** on train set, validation set and test set respectively.

**Tech Stack:**
  1. Tensorflow
  2. Python
  3. Streamlit
